'''
Class: OpticalEquipment
Generic superclass for all cameras and projectors used in the set up. Cameras
and projectors can both be represented as an imaging surface and a reference
point. This class contains the information defining those two features and
their calibration.

Superclass of <Projector> and <Camera>

Attributes:
pose - ndarray The 4x4 matrix representing the position and
orientation of the piece of optical equipment in world coordinates
intrinsicMatrix - ndarray The 3x3 matrix representing the intrinsic parameters of
the piece of optical equipment
distortion - ndarray The lens distortion coefficients of the optical equipment
''' 
class OpticalEquipment(object):
    def __init__(self, pose, intrinsicMatrix, distortion):
        self.pose = pose
        self.intrinsicMatrix = intrinsicMatrix
        self.distortion = distortion

'''
Class: Camera
Contains all information relevant to a physical camera. This
includes a reference to the video capture device itself and the information
necessary to convert images from the world space to camera space that result
from calibration.

Subclass of <OpticalEquipment>

Attributes:
device - OpenCV VideoCapture object that can be used to capture an image
'''
class Camera(OpticalEquipment):
    def __init__(self, device, pose, intrinsicMatrix, distortion):
        super(Camera, self).__init__(pose, intrinsicMatrix, distortion)
        self.device = device

    def capture_image(self):
        capturedImage, image = self.device.read()
        if capturedImage:
            return Image(image, self, None)
        else:
            raise Excpetion("Image capture failed. retval=" + retval)
        
'''
Function: capture_image
Given the device location information for a camera, this orders that
camera to take a picture, and then captures the information in that
picture and returns it as an <Image> object

Parameters:
device - OpenCV VideoCapture object to take the image with

Return:
An <Image> object containing the captured data

'''
Class: Projector
Contains all information relevant to a physical projector, whether it is a
DLP, LED-and-grating, or any other kind of system. This system type is
defined by the <type> property and is used to make sure a given projector can
project a given pattern in <projectPattern>.

Subclass of <OpticalEquipment>
Superclass of <DLPProjector>

class DLPProjector(Projector):
    '''
     Method: project_pattern
     Takes a <DLPPattern>, and projects the given
     pattern with the given projector. It returns a <GeneratedPattern>
     object representing the actual light field created by the projection.
     
     Simultaneously, it projects this pattern in the physical world using the
     provided projector.
     
     Parameters:
     pattern - the <DLPPattern> to be created by the projector

     Return:
     a generated pattern that (nearly) perfectly represents the light field
     created by the projector.
