Add offset to gray code scan

Vectorize gray_scan code to support fast operations for multiple cameras

If we keep gray code scan, make it probabilistic

in gray_scan.extract_point_cloud, check for the correct pattern sequence

In gray_scan, make sure assumptions about the timing of undistorting the image
are OK.  Also do something intelligent about the projector distortion.

Make normalize testing more full, or find an alternative in numpy

Vectorize fit_plane (is that possible???)

Add unit tests for line_plane_intersection, projector_planes

Vectorize the call to line_plane_intersection in extract_point_cloud

Finish debugging extract_point_cloud
