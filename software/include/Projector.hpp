 * Class: Projector
 * Contains all information relevant to a physical projector, whether it is a

 * project a given pattern in <projectPattern>.

 * type - the type of this projector, as defined in <ProjectorType> enum

   * Method: projectPattern
   * Takes a <Projector> and a <Pattern> and, if the given projector can project the
   * given pattern, returns a <GeneratedPattern> object that contains the matrix
   * of pixel values representing the light pattern created by the projector.
   * This takes into account the spacial location and orientation of the
   * projector and any distortions of the projector from the ideal.
   *
   * Simultaneously, it projects this pattern in the physical world using te
   * provided projector.
   *
   * Parameters:
   * projector - the projector to be used to create the pattern
   * pattern - the definition of the pattern to be created by the projector
   *
   * Return:
   * a generated pattern that (nearly) perfectly represents the light field
   * created by the projector.
