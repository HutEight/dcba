    Class: OpticalEquipment
    Generic superclass for all cameras and projectors used in the set up. Cameras
    and projectors can both be represented as an imaging surface and a reference
    point. This class contains the information defining those two features and
    their calibration.

    Superclass of <Projector> and <Camera>

    Attributes:
    R - *ndarray* The 3x3 rotation matrix rotating from the global coordinate frame to the
    coordinate frame of the piece of optical equipment
    T - *ndarray* The length 3 numpy array giving the location of the global frame origin
    in the optical equipment coordinate frame
    extrinsic_matrix - *ndarray* The 4x3 matrix representing the position and
    orientation of the piece of optical equipment in world coordinates. Is equivalent to [R|T]
    focal_length - *ndarray* 2x1 vector representing the x and y focal lengths for the
    camera, i.e. [fx, fy]
    principal_point - *ndarray* 2x1 vector representing the two components of the principal
    point, or camera center. In the form [cx, cy]
    alpha - The skew, i.e., the angle that the x and y pixel axes are off by, e.g.,
    alpha of .5 would imply the angle between the x and y pixel axes is 89.5
    intrinsic_matrix - *ndarray* The 3x3 matrix representing the intrinsic parameters of
    the piece of optical equipment. In the form:
    [[fx, alpha*fx, cx],
     [0, fy, cy],
     [0, 0, 1]]
    distortion - *ndarray* The lens distortion coefficients of the optical equipment
    resolution - *Tuple* of the form (width, height), giving the resolution of
    the piece of optical equpiment
