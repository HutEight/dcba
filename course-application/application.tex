\section*{Opportunity Areas}
Our accomplished, enthusiastic team was assembled to have the traits necessary
to build a successful hardware startup. After the past few weeks of
brainstorming and preliminary market research, we have filtered our ideas down
to three products that all fit our skill set and that we would love to create.
We plan to spend the first two weeks of the class continuing to research markets
and interview customers, as well as consult with the course's advisors in order
to choose the product we will develop over the semester.

\subsection*{Opportunity Areas}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \underline{Specific Molarity Solution Maker} -- Low-cost machine for preparing solutions with arbitrary molarities from stock chemicals. Automates the time-consuming process of calculating and carefully weighing out precise quantities of chemicals for making a solution, along with mixing and autoclaving. Markets include academic and small commercial wet labs.
\item \underline{Robotic Oxygen Tank Carrier} -- Robotic assistant for carrying medical oxygen tanks. The device maintains a specified distance from the user by following a signal generated on the users body. Incorporates a LIDAR system for obstacle detection and path planning. The product would enable greater independence and mobility for individuals who require oxygen tanks. Markets include hospitals, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and medical rehabilitation centers.
\item \underline{Smart-Home Doorbell} -- Video camera, intercom integrated into doorbell system that allows the homeowner to see and communicate with whoever is at their door via an AV feed to a smartphone app. The user can then choose to unlock the door via the app to let the caller in. Adds convenience and security; would be very useful for package delivery that requires confirmation. Aside from general homeowners, marketable as an inexpensive upgrade to old apartment buzzer systems.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{\href{http://www.troyastorino.com}{Troy Astorino}} (AeroAstro,
Physics `13) -- \textbf{About:} Troy's interest in machine learning and robotics
has led him to take classes from a wide variety of departments outside of his
two majors. He participated in StartLabs' C2C program last IAP and firmly
believes that startups can change the world through building profitable
businesses around products and services. \textbf{Skill set:} Troy's experience
with large software systems and his academic focus on probabilistic robotics
will be used in building the software and sensor integration for the project.
\textbf{Desired units:} 24. \textbf{Adviser's email:}
