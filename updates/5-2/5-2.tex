\section{Plan Progress}
We got feedback from the Founders Skills Accelerator. Unfortunately, we were not
accepted to the program.  The feedback that we got was that although we were a
great team and were committed, they felt that our idea was weak. Specifically,
they felt that we hadn't fleshed out our idea as much as we should have for the
amount of time we had spent on the project. In the first interview, some of the
judges doubted the technical viability of the project, and in the second
interview, one of the judges thought that we had chosen a market segment that
would be impossible to target.

Although we worked hard on our presentation, we were not prepared to answer the
kinds of questions they were asking. With a longer conversation we would have
assuaged their doubts, but we were not practiced in addressing concerns in a
fast-paced Q&A format. Additionally, we only pitched our product in a nebulous
and high-level fashion. This resulted in us coming off as naive and unprepared.
In our presentations, we need to present a specified vision, and make it easier
for others to grasp onto.

Regarding the specific concerns: although we believe that the technical concerns
are unfounded, the concerns about the potential market certainly worry us. We
will meet with the judges that had experience with 3D scanning, namely Bill
Aulet and Dave Hart, in order to explore those concerns. Discussing these
concerns might show us that we need to pivot, but at the very least it will help
learn to communicate our ideas in the space more effectively. 

However, we are postponing these discussions and learning opportunities until
the end of the class; we need to be 100\% focused on developing a prototype.
