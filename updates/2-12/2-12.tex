\section{Plan Progress}
Following the comments we received after being accepted into the class, we
rebroadened our search for potential products, focusing more on market viability
and interaction with potential customers.  We identified five major areas we
wanted to investigate, and after meeting with specialists in those
areas and evaluating potential market sizes, we've narrowed down the scope of
our search. We have two products/product areas that we think are very promising,
and are waiting to pass judgment on two other market areas (Biomedical robotics
and urbal/local agriculture) pending meetings on
Wednesday. We are meeting with Professors Gifford and Zolot on Thursday
to discuss our market analysis and get advice on a decision. We plan on
selecting a product and starting design by Friday. 

The products we have narrowed to are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Extensions of Leap Motion. Looking at two possible options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Solution to make CAD work practically with the Leap
\begin{itemize}
\item Ergonomically impractical to work with Leap for extended periods of time
  (waving hands in the air) - some apparatus to hold the Leap device or your
  arms to make CADing with the Leap for many hours feasible
\item Haptic feedback to make using the Leap with CAD models more useful than
  simply using a 3D mouse
\end{itemize}
\item Inexpensive and accurate 3D scanning using the Leap
\begin{itemize}
\item TODO Compare to market for MakerBot
\item Can build off development efforts to do color scanning with Kinect
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Inexpensive LIDAR for low-cost robotics. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Low-cost robotic applications rapidly growing field; as measure of size,
  in May 2011 300,000 Arduinos out in the world
\item LIDAR extremely useful and common for serious robotic applications, but
  typical price of \$6k makes it inaccessible for consumer or hobbyist applications
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Prototype Progress}
As we haven't yet chosen the product we are going to produce, we do not have any
prototype progress this week.
