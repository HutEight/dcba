Here are some of the things I (Troy) noticed while going through and
understanding the code:

Calibration variables:
x_1 - Locations of features on the image plane (x,y coordinates)
X_1 - Locations of the x_1 features in the checkerboard coordinate space (x,y,z
coordinates, but relative to the calibration object (the checkerboard), so z can simply
be set to 0)

fc - focal length (fx, fy)
cc - principal point (cx, cy)
alpha - skew coefficient (scalar)
These three intrinsic parameters make up the intrinsic matrix, or camera matrix.
It is of the form:
[[fx alpha cx]
 [0   fy   cy]
 [0   0    1 ]]
kc - distortion parameters.  In the same order as those for OpenCV
Tc_1, Tc_2, ... - Translation vectors for each of the features.  Somehow for the
projector calibration it gets it just uses the first...not sure why it can do
this
Rc_1, Rc_2, ... - 3D rotation matrices. Again somehow only the first is used.
Not sure how or why

Main call for optimization: go_calib_optim_iter
