Highland questions:
1. What problem are you solving, and why is it important to solve?

2. How did your team come together to solve this problem?

3. What do you hope to accomplish by the end of the summer?

Highland notes:
We suggest using YouTube or Vimeo to host your video. We ask you NOT TO PASSWORD PROTECT the video, but simply make it a private URL. No need to get super fancy, or high production value-y. Just show your enthusiasm and focus on getting the point across.

Also, no screencasts. We want to see your smiling faces!

Script:
Little joke (maybe about trying to smile the whole time?)

Intros - name and (major or role on team)
Gus - physicist posing as optical engineer (or 'optics guy')
Craig - MechE, Master of mechanical stuff
Troy - AeroAstro/Physics, delusionally programmer/biz guy

How we came together (brainstormed hardware/robotics-y startups
that we thought had market potential and fit our skill set/intersts)
